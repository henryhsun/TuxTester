**Key Features**

- Automated cyclic testing to simulate mat wear over 10,000+ cycles

- Adjustable load application up to 100 lbs

- Extruded aluminum framing, 3D printed fixtures and custom machined brackets

- Programmable test parameters: cycle count, duty cycle, PWM tuned speed

- Cycle counting and live feedback LCD

- Low-cost benchtop design (<$1000)

- Modular: 2 configurations to simulate different real-world movement patterns

- Integrated fan cooling system enabling sustained high-duty-cycle operation

- Arduino control with LCD user interface and safety shut-off loop
